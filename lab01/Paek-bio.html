<body>
    Hi! My name is Timothy Paek, and I'm a computer science major with interests in software development and machine
    learning.
    I have received the 1870 Scholarship, Invest in SUccess Scholarship, and Orange Distinction Award and have been on
    Dean's List all semesters on campus.
    My skills include Java, Python, Git, and machine learning.

    However, outside of school, I like to play instruments like the piano and guitar. I also like to do gymnastics.
    I like romance films and books and the like. I watched primarily kdrama romances last year, so this year I've been
    trying to watch more American romcom films.
    My favorite movie of all time probably has to be Everything Everywhere All at Once, and I have no idea what my
    favorite show is, though I would probably say it would be Jujutsu Kaisen right now.
