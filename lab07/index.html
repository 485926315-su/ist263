    <h1>Timothy Paek's Biography</h1>

    <p>
        Hi! My name is Timothy Paek, and I'm a computer science major with interests in software development and machine
        learning.
        I have received the 1870 Scholarship, Invest in SUccess Scholarship, and Orange Distinction Award and have been
        on
        Dean's List all semesters on campus.
        My skills include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Git</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Personal info</h2>
    <p>
        However, outside of school, I like to play instruments like the piano, guitar, and ukulele. I also like to do
        gymnastics.
        I also like romcoms.
        My favorite movie of all time probably has to be <strong>Everything Everywhere All at Once</strong>, and I have
        no idea what my
        favorite show is, though I would probably say it would be Jujutsu Kaisen right now.
